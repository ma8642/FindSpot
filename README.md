FindSpot App Updated Vision Statement

1.  App Name:  FindSpot.


2.  Need:  This app is intended to help Bard students find a room on campus that is not currently in use.  This is targeted toward many different needs including students who work better in solitary environments, students who have roommates and want some peace and quiet, students who are trying to do a private phone call or skype interview, students who want to meditate, students who need to take a nap, etc.,.
 
3.  Vision Statment:  In 2 years we would hope that this app would be fully functioning in cooperation with the space.bard.edu website, and that it would have room-claiming and official registration capabilites.  The process of actually booking a room would have to be a little more involved so that only people that really wanted to use a room would do that.  We wouldn’t want people booking spaces “just in case” and then not using them.  Maybe the final app would also show where other users are so that even if a user hasn’t laid claim to a spot, their presence will appear on the map and notify other user who would otherwise visit that room.


4.  Major Features:  This app will either communicate space.bard.edu database or a static SQLite datbase of inside.bard.edu. We will have to implement a clickable campus map, activity-fragment interactions, and possibly complex database querying.  The process of selecting a time slot will be a very similar to the Google Calendar app so we may need to reference that.


5.  Portion of App to be Completed:  By the end of the semester we hope to have an app with a clickable map that opens a fragments that displays availabilities of rooms in Olin and RKC.


6.  Implementation Environment:  This app is intended for mobile android phones.  Ideally there would also be an iOS version as well.  The information about room availabilities is located on the space.bard.edu database or the course catalogue, and the app will also keep its own database of user room claims.


7.  Competitive Analysis:  This app has no other competitor apps at the moment.  The only other service that is related is the space.bard.edu website that is used for booking spaces, but this is a multi-step procedure that may take several days to process.  Furthermore the current conception of this app is not intended to be used for making official space registrations, but rather to allow app users take advantage of the the space.bard.edu database on the spur of the moment.  There would be space-claiming capabilities, but they would only be to alert other users that there is someone currently in the space.
