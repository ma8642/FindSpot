# Project for CMSC 374 Mobile Apps
FindSpot App Goals

1.  App Name:  FindSpot.

2.  Need:  This app is intended to help Bard College students find a room on campus that is not currently in use.  This is targeted toward many different needs including students who work better in solitary environments, students who have roommates and want some peace and quiet, students who are trying to do a private phone call or skype interview, students who want to meditate, students who need to take a nap, etc.,.

3.  The goals of this app were to use a database of courses to extract data about room availability on campus.  We wanted to present the data in a clear, easy to use format and utilize knowledge we gained about app structure from our Mobile Apps class (CMSC 374).

4.  Portion of App Completed:  The app starts off with a campus map where the user can tap Olin or RKC.  This then opens a fragment with a list of rooms that are currently free in the chosen building.  User can view list and return back to the campus map.  Courses listed are for the Spring 2017 semester.
